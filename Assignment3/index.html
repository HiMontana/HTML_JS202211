        <p>     Hello, I’m Miasia aka Montana aka Tk I’m 18, and I graduated from Poughkeepsie High School in 2022. I grew up
            in Poughkeepsie, New York. I have 4 Sisters and 3 brothers. When I was younger I loved playing on my DS. I
            played Super Smash Brothers and Mario Kart all day. I even brought it to school one day and got it taken
            away. It was an unfortunate experience. It wasn’t until l 2011 I played the first game I was absolutely
            addicted to this game <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blackops" class="link">Call of Duty Black Ops</a>.</p>
          
        <p>      My older brothers were playing the zombies mode on Call of Duty Black Ops and I was so fascinated by all the
            movements and actions of the game. One day they found some glitch in the game that allowed them to play a 4
            player split screen. At first, they were playing with two of their friends but then one went home and they
            asked me to play. It was my first time playing with a controller. I was so bad then I gradually got better
            and better. I didn’t get my own console until years later that’s when I really got into video games. I would
            stay up all day and night playing Grand Theft Auto Online with my friends and my mom would get mad at me. I
            am a certified console gamer and now I am an anime nerd so… yeah that’s me.
